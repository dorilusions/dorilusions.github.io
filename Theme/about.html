                Dorothy had her first encounter with anime in elementary school, but did not fall into the abyss until
                the end of seventh grade.
                She never saw the light of day again. After numerous attempts at making it back out, she has settled
                comfortably halfway up the
                abyss wall, accepting her status as a weeb with her backpack full of countless husbandos. Thankfully,
                she has managed to stop
                marathoning 50 episodes of anime a day with rigorous self-therapy, though she still continues to keep
                up with a select few anime
                each season. At this point, Dorothy has some 200 anime under her belt, and considers herself a cultured
                and experienced member of
                the anime community. In reality, she's really just a piece of anime trash with no taste.

                The only (arguably) good thing that came out of Dorothy watching anime was that it sparked her passion
                for art, resulting in a
                doe-eyed anime girl on every other page of her notebooks. She continues to enjoy drawing and posts her
                art on Instagram for her
                grand following of 80 people to see. Hopefully, this let you learn more about Dorothy, even though
                theres not much to know!
