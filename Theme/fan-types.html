            <h1 class="overview"> Types of Anime Fans</h1>
            <h2> The Ones Who Have A Life/The Casual</h2>
                <p> These sorts of anime fans have somewhat prioritized and put anime in the backseat, but still
                    enjoy the occasional show if they have time.  They are healthiest type of anime fan, and have found their 
                    life/anime balance.
                </p>
            <h2> The Collector</h2>
                <p> This sort of anime fan spends large amounts of money on anime merchandise they can't afford.
                    Comes hand in hand with college debt. This type should not be left alone at any sort of convention,
                    EVER.
                </p>

            <h2> The Hype Beast</h2>
                <p> Watches anime soley for the excitement and not for the plot, which is highly annoying for the Intellectuals.
                    They solely enjoy trending shonen anime, and will not stop spewing hype once you get them started. 
                </p>
            <h2> The Intellectual </h2>
                <p> The Intellectual feels that they have the greatest/most superior taste in anime, and finds the Hype Beast to have extremely
                    trash taste.  They really like to use the word "plot". Do not try to argue with them, unless you would like to be bashed for 
                    a couple of hours.
