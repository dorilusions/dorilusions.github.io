                The roots of anime lie in 1917—still the age of silent films—through hand-drawn panels and cutout
                animation
                based on animated shorts from France and the United States. However, Japanese anime were costlier to
                produce than Western
                animations and were overshadowed by the popularity of Disney cartoons. Despite the setbacks,domestic
                anime production began to develop
                a small but solid foundation until Tokyo was hit by the Great Kantō Earthquake in 1923. The anime
                industry was forced to
                start over from scratch, not realizing that it was a warning from God that their creations would
                destroy minds from the
                inside out 100 years in the future.

                The industry continued to struggle through the World Wars, with anime managing to find a small niche in
                the propoganda
                industry. Throughout the 50s, anime began to take a hold as people abandoned firearms for peace and
                leisure. During the 1970s,
                anime developed further, developing distinct genres such as the mecha genre (Gundam is still huge, just
                search up the statue).
                Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy (as shown in the picture), Lupin III and Mazinger Z.
                Several filmmakers from this period
                became famous, especially Hayao Miyazaki (STUDIO GHIBLI HECK YEAH) and Mamoru Oshii.

            <aside>
                Side note: anyone who hasn't watched a Ghibli movie needs to do so, right now. They're classics and
                also Academy Award-winning,
                if that says anything.
            </aside>

            <p>Anime boomed during the 1980s, with anime such as Gundam, Dragon Ball, Pokemon (if that even counts lol)
                and genres such
                as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk. Space Battleship Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress
                Macross also achieved
                worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and Robotech. Finally, anime reached
                international fame
                in the 21st century, and eventually reached a pimply middle schooler by the name of Dorothy.
