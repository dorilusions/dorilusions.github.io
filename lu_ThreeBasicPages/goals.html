        <!-- The way I read the assignment, the website link was supposed to be similar to the navigational text links. -->

            Also, check out one of my favorite artists (which was also my website analysis assignment website) at 
            <a href="http://www.jonasdero.com/"> Jonas DeRo's Website </a>!  His work is super cool and I aspire to be 
            like him someday! :)
