            <p> 'Anime' is Japanese abbreviation of the word 'animation' is technically used to refer to all animation.
                To those outside
                Japan, it has become the term for animation specifically from Japan, though some Western companies such
                as Netflix have
                also been attempting to break into producing anime (rip). Originally, anime was produced by and for
                Japan onlyâ€”
                a local product, with a distinct look-and-feel to not just the artwork but the storytelling, the
                themes, and the concepts.
                Since the 1980s or so, it has become an international phenomenon, attracting millions of (literally)
                crazy fans and being
                translated into many languages. </p>

            <p>What is it that makes this anime so special compared to other animation outside Japan? The answer to
                that is pretty simple:
                its different. These differences are pretty clear once you watch. From the artwork to the storytelling,
                breadth of material
                (like.....how do they even come up with some of those ideas, seriously) and even cultural nuances
                exhibited by the characters,
                all of these are extremely differernt from what can be seen in Western-style animation. Well, most
                western animation, with the
                exception of a couple of shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender which is still being debated upon as
                to whether of not it counts
                as an anime.</p>

            <p>One distinctive trait that immediately sets anime apart is the art style. Anime art styles can range
                from the flamboyant and outlandish
                in shows like Yu-Gi-O-- *coughs* One Piece to the simple and direct in shows like "Ping-Pong the
                Animation." That said, even shows with
                more "basic" artwork are still visually striking with few exceptions. </p>

            <p> Unlike the nation producing it, anime is not always shy and polite, especially regarding content. Most
                anime typically run in
                seasons, with each season running around 12-30 episodes and most anime running about one or two
                seasons. Approximately 30
                (though this number is growing) new anime are produced each season. This adds up to a total of around
                12,000 animes that have
                been produced since it first started. This also means that studios are forever trying to find different
                stories to produce,
                which can be......interesting when you decide to read some summaries of anime. However, popular anime
                can run for dozens (sometimes
                hundreds) of episodes. The best anime, though, no matter what their length, all demand great emotional
                involvement from the viewer. </p>

            <p>The sheer range of anime shows out there means a fan of most any other kind of TV or movie can find an
                anime series that mirrors its
                style. For fans of hard science fiction, the show Neon Genesis Evangelion would be perfect for you;
                romantic comedy fans will love
                Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama, and crimefighting lovers will enjoy "Ghost in the Shell." There are even
                adaptations of classical literature
                like The Count of Monte Cristo.</p>

            <p>Anime fans often recieve a bad rep for being "too into it," but it is something everyone really needs to
                see for themselves to judge.
                Stop calling me cancer, guys...</p>
