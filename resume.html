        **NOTE TO READER: This is probably a really horrific resume but I can guarantee that a majority of it is not true.
        The minority that is true...I'll leave that to the imagination :D

            "Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow." -Ben Franklin
            <br> My goal is to meet standards by the skin of my teeth by being the laziest, most unmotivated
            barely functional procrastinator in existence.

        <p class="sub">
            Used minimal movement and energy to teach children how to float and move forward in water,
            and was able to sometimes teach without getting in the water at all due to my dislike of getting
            wet (showering is a hassle). Made sure to take as little shifts as possible that would still
            earn a passing performance review.

            Sat next to students and zoned out in their direction so they would think an eye was being
            kept on them as they did homework--a highly efficient and energy-saving system. Very occasionally
            gave helpful tips about the content that was supposed to be learned.
