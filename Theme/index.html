            <p> Boba, or Bubble Tea, is a drink originated from Taiwan that contains tea, milk, and usually also sugar and optional flavorings.
                Toppings such as chewy tapioca balls (also known as pearls, or boba) are commonly added. Boba culture started in the late '80s, 
                most likely in Taipei (though other cities in Taiwan often claim ownership). Milk tea was already well-known in Taiwan, 
                as tea drinking was a staple in East Asia. At the time, tapioca balls were common dessert toppings for desserts such as shaved ice. 
                During one hot summer, a food stall owner thought to combine three popular elements into one beverageâ€”tapioca balls on the bottom, 
                followed by a layer of shaved ice, and milk tea to fill out the rest of the drink.
